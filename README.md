I have included two implementations since the requirements were not precise. For example, I was unsure if you consider cords to be part of the fan. In real life, I would get the requirements from the client first.

1. Implementation 01 is a standalone implementation of a ceiling fan, which assumes that cords are attached to the fan
2. Implementation 02 is implementing ceiling fan using command pattern where change speed and reversing direction is considered commands instead of the parts attached to the fan
